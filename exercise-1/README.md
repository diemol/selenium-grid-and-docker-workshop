* Start Selenium Grid with Docker

* Run a few tests

### Start Selenium Grid with Docker

1. On a terminal, under the `exercise_1` directory, type `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3.yml up`. This will start a Grid with a Hub and 3 Nodes.
2. Head to your machine/instance url, and check the port `4444`
